# Introduction : 

HR Access is Human Resource Management application. 
It contains a code generator which generates Cobol code. 

https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/HR_Access

This technical package is deliver "as-is". It has been used in a limited number of situations.
This package has been tested in CAST 8.2.x 


This extension excludes COBOL quality rules violations that are part of HR Access generated code.

Only COBOL quality rule violation that is part of a non generated code block will be kept: which means only the UTTB paragraphs. 

Example : 

![UTTB Paragraph](/UTTB_paragraph.jpg)

This only applies to COBOL quality rules with bookmarks so:

* Avoid using HANDLE CONDITION
* Avoid using IGNORE CONDITION
* Avoid using HANDLE ABEND
* Using SEARCH ALL only with sorted data
* Avoid using SORT
* Avoid using MERGE
* Avoid using ALTER
* Avoid using PERFORM ... THROUGH | THRU
* Avoid STOP RUN (use GOBACK instead)
* Avoid DISPLAY ... UPON CONSOLE
* Avoid Procedure Paragraphs that contains no statements
* Avoid Procedure Sections that contain no Paragraphs.
* Avoid using Sections in the PROCEDURE DIVISION (use Paragraphs only)
* Avoid using NEXT SENTENCE
* Include a WHEN OTHER clause when using EVALUATE
* Avoid using MOVE CORRESPONDING ... TO ...
* Avoid undocumented Sections
* Avoid undocumented Paragraphs
* Avoid using GOTO statement
* Avoid OPEN/CLOSE inside loops
* EVALUATE statements must be closed by END-EVALUATE
* Avoid recursive calls with PERFORM statements
* Avoid GOTO jumps out of PERFORM range
* Avoid cyclic calls with PERFORM statements
* Avoid unreferenced Sections and Paragraphs
* Avoid using Pointers
* IF statements must be closed by END-IF
* File descriptor block must be defined with 0 record
* When using binary data items (COMP), then use the SYNCHRONIZED clause
* Avoid using inline PERFORM with too many lines of code
* Subprograms called multiple times should be called statically
* Never use incompatible statements with the CICS environment
* Avoid using nested programs
* Avoid accessing data by using the position and length
* Programs accessing relational databases must include the SQLCA copybook
* Avoid executing multiple OPEN statements
* Never truncate data in MOVE statements
* Avoid unchecked return code (SQLCODE) after EXEC SQL query
* Each opened file must be closed
* Avoid calling the same paragraph with PERFORM and GO TO statements
* Files should be declared with a FILE-STATUS
* Sections and paragraphs should be located after the first statement calling them
* Avoid using COMPUTE statement for elementary arithmetic operation
* Avoid using READ statement without AT END clause
* Check alphanumeric data before moving them into numeric data
* Variables defined in Working-Storage section must be initialized before to be read
